# Machine-Learning-Libraries

## Overview
  + In this project we tried to explore different **Machine Learning** classification algorithms on three different datasets.
  + Three Datasets are Medical data, Railways Data and fashion MNIST data (all uploaded in datasets folder)
  + This Project is divided in three different parts:
    + Part1 implement following algorithms: 
      + *Bayes and Naive Bayes Classifier*
      + *Gaussian Mixture Model*
      + *Kernel density estimation via Parzen-Rosenblatt Window*
      + *KNN*
      + *Kcluster*
    + Part 2 implement these algorithms:
      + *Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis*
      + *SVM with Linear and Gaussian Kernel*
    + Part 3 implements these algorithms:
      + *Bayesian and Perceptron classifier to predict cognitive skills*
      + *CNN for fMNIST classification*
      + *LSTM for pattern detection in the signal*  
  + Each part contains **Analysis Report** with detailed mention about why specific algorithm works better on one dataset and not on others.
